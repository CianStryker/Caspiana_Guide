# Maintenance Guide for CASPIANA
CASPIANA is obviously an unfinished product and will need to be updated and expanded periodically. The website has a contribution form that you should check occasionally to see if anyone has submitted additional information. The google form that collects those submissions is tied to CASPIANA's email address. Assuming you are logged into the email address, you can access the google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/2/). 

Whether you get new information from that form or from other places, you should do the following to update CASPIANA: 

- First: Add/Update the new source in the Google Drive

- Second: Add/Update that source to the spreadsheet version

- Third: Copy that information and paste it into both the country's page as well as the subject page on the Omeka website.

- Fourth: Add/Update an Omeka item so that it can be found by users through the search bar

For example, if you recieve a new Kazakh media source you should first input that source into the "Media" google doc in the Google Drive, making sure to follow the formatting used for other sources. Then you should input that information into the Caspiana spreadsheet data. Third, copy the source from the Google Drive and paste it into Caspiana's website (both on the Media:Kazakhstan page, but also on the Kazakhstan:Media page). Finally, go to "Items" from the Admin side of Omeka to create a new item for this source so that users can find it via the search bar. 


# Recovery Guide
If for some reason you completely lose CASPIANA's spreadsheet version, you can recover most of the information by exporting items from Omeka. This process requires a plugin in a fair amount of data cleaning. See the [Recovery Guide](https://github.com/CianStryker/Caspiana_Guide/tree/main/Maintenance%20Guide/Recovery%20Guide) for details.
