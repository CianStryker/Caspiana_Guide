# Maintenance Guide for CASPIANA
CASPIANA is obviously an unfinished product and will need to be updated and expanded periodically. The website has a contribution form that you should check occasionally to see if anyone has submitted additional information. The google form that collects those submissions is tied to CASPIANA's email address. Assuming you are logged into the email address, you can access the google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/2/). 

Whether you get new information from that form or from other places, you should do the following to update CASPIANA: 

- First: Add/Update the new source in the Google Drive

- Second: Add/Update that source to the spreadsheet version

- Third: Copy that information and paste it into both the country's page as well as the subject page on the Omeka website. 

- Fourth: Add/Update an Omeka item so that it can be searched by users through the search bar. 


# Caspiana Recovery Guide
If you were to completely lose the spreadsheet version of CASPIANA, there is a way to recover most of the information from the Omeka platform. I don't think this is likely to happen to you, but I am including some information on how to recover CASPIANA from Omeka in a sub-folder.
