# Maintenance Guide for CASPIANA
CASPIANA is obviously an unfinished product and will need to be updated and expanded periodically. The website has a contribution form that you should check occasionally to see if anyone has submitted additional information. The google form that collects those submissions is tied to CASPIANA's email address. Assuming you are logged into the email address, you can access the google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/2/). 

Whether you get new information from that form or from other places, you should do the following to update CASPIANA: 

- First: Add/Update the new source in the Google Drive

- Second: Add/Update that source to the spreadsheet version

- Third: Copy that information and paste it into both the country's page as well as the subject page on the Omeka website. 

- Fourth: Add/Update an Omeka item so that it can be found by users through the search bar


# Recovery Guide
If for some reason you completely lose CASPIANA's spreadsheet version you recover most of the information by exporting the information from Omeka. This process requires a plugin in a fair amount of data cleaning. See the [Recovery Guide](https://github.com/CianStryker/Caspiana_Guide/tree/main/Maintenance%20Guide/Recovery%20Guide) for details.
