Another reason we decided to use an Omeka platform that is hosted by Harvard is because [Academic Technology for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences](https://atg.fas.harvard.edu/) is available to help students and faculty with technical issues. 

In creating CASPIANA I was helped by Hugh Truslow (truslow@fas.harvard.edu) in making the interactive map and Jeremy Guillette (jguillette@fas.harvard.edu) with writing some of the CSS and Html. If you can't figure something out, please feel free to contact them.
