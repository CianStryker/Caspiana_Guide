# CASPIANA Guide
CASPIANA is product of Harvard University's Davis Center Program on Central Asia. It provides resources to students and scholars of Central Asia and the South Caucasus by supplying links to selected media sources, government portals, legislation databases, statistics, and academic resources to study eight countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Caspiana was started by Nargis Kassenova and myself (Cian Stryker). We hired research assistants from each of the target countries to compile sources and list them in a Google Drive. At a later date, I recreated Caspiana in a spreadsheet format before we used Omeka to create the actual website. This Github repository's purpose is to describe how Caspiana is formatted to anyone interested, but also to serve as a guide for Davis Center Program on Central Asia Research Assistants who need to update or maintain the website. 

Caspiana is maintained in three forms: in an Omeka Website, in Google Docs, and in a Spreadsheet. Maintaining Caspiana requires you to update all three formats. The Omeka Website and the Spreadsheet both need vareity of programming languages for maintainence and so those sections will include my code sheets and explanations. The Google Drive is more self-explanatory, but I will include some cursory information as well as a link to the Drive itself. The Mainteneance Guide is largely just a walkthrough of how to update the website, but I will also include information on how to export the Omeka website in an emergency.
