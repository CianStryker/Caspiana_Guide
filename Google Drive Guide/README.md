# Google Drive Guide for CASPIANA
We originally created CASPIANA in a google drive and much of its maintenance is still done there. The Google Drive contains CASPIANA's email login information, all of our survey information, and copies of our spreadsheet version of the website. CASPIANA is essentially a list of urls and titles, but for certain categories of entries we also have descriptions attached. These categories include all of Media, all of Study Abroad Resources, all of Language Resources, and some Legislations sources. These descriptions are written in the google doc first, before being copied into the spreadsheet version or the actual website. In order to keep an organized backup, you should also include all additional sources (even those without descriptions) in the google drive as your first step and then go on to update everything else. 

The Google Drive can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1F9d276yZIAbxa8VA8c3YGIKhDlQEaS8f). If you do not have access, please ask the Program on Central Asia's Director for permission to be included as an editor. The Google Drive contains a more in-depth [readme](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Il0Rp2RxFPrZl7G81kY2Skkbm1jGexYa_IDdpDEILhc/edit).
