# Omeka Website Guide for CASPIANA
We decided to use Omeka to host CASPIANA's offical website because Harvard hosts a server for us and because it is more user friendly for future research assistants. Much of Omeka is somewhat self-explanatory, but I will try to create a general walkthrough here so people new to the platform can more easily adapt to Omeka. To understand how CASPIANA is designed you need to be aware of Omeka's base formatting (along with the custom html I wrote), my CSS edits, how we created our interactive map, and where you can find all the images. I will have four sections within the Omeka Website Guide: Overall Omeka Guide, CSS Guide, Map Guide, and a Images folder.

# Help 
Another reason we decided to use Omeka hosted by Harvard is because [Academic Technology for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences](https://atg.fas.harvard.edu/) is available to help students and faculty with technical issues. 

In creating CASPIANA I was helped by Hugh Truslow (truslow@fas.harvard.edu) in making the interactive map and Jeremy Guillette (jguillette@fas.harvard.edu) with writing some of the CSS and Html. If you can't figure something out, please feel free to contact them.
