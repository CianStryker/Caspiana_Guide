# CSS and Html Guide
In order to customize Caspiana's Omeka site, I use both CSS in the CSS Editor Plugin and Html in the Html editor windows for most pages on the site. There are two separate word documents and pdfs included here where I explain the code I use for the CSS plugin and some of the html I wrote for pages. Each document includes comments that explain most of what I have done. You can access the pdfs directly from Github. To access the word documents though, click on them and then hit "view raw" to download them. In general, if you have issues with either CSS or Html, googling the issue may help you figure it out. If you are really stuck, however, you should reach out to Jeremy Guillette (jguillette@fas.harvard.edu).
