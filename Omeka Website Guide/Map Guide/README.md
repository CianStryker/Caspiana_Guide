# CASPIANA Homepage Map
The map on the homepage was somewhat complicated to create. The base version of the map was created in ArcGIS Pro and is included here as Caspiana_Map_ArcGIS.pdf". Then a second version was created in Adobe Illustrator to include some basic coloring and country labels. Three versions (ai, jpg, and pdf) of this stage of the map are included, all labelled "Caspiana_Map_ArcGIS-Illustrator". At the last stage, our graphics designer created the final version with a color scheme we all agreed on, which is listed here as "Caspiana_Final_Version.jpg". 

To make the map interactive I used https://www.image-map.net. In Image-map type in the [map's url](https://s3.amazonaws.com/atg-prod-oaas-files/caspiana/original/e47a33a49d4272de783795ac2935fac8.jpg) from its item entry in Omeka and then you can create shapefiles for each country by tracing their borders with polygons. Input the url for the Omeka page for each country and then click on "Show Me the Code". Copy that code and insert into the homepage's html editor. See the html section of this repo to understand that specific formatting. 

In order to insert images into CASPIANA or to use Image-map, you need an image's url. When you upload an image into Omeka, it recieves a url. Simply click on the image's item on the admin side of Omeka, click on the image again, then click on it once again, and then you should see the image with a black background. Once you see the background, you can copy that window's url.
