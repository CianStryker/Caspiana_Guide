# Images for CASPIANA
In this folder simply included the images used in CASPIANA's Omeka website. The Caspiana logo and header are listed as "caspiana_logo.jpg" and "caspiana_header.jpg" respectively. I also included the adobe illustrator version of the header if you would like to make changes directly in that platform. I also included the Davis Center's logo as well, which is located in the footer of every page on the website. All flag images can also be found in the "Flags" folder. Note: All flag images were taken from Wikipedia and were labelled open for public use. 

In order to insert images into CASPIANA you need an image's URL. When you upload an image into Omeka, it receives a URL. Simply click on the image's item on the admin side of Omeka, click on the image again, then click on it a third time, and then you should see the image with a black background. Once you see the background, you can copy that window's URL and insert it into the html editor for any page in Omeka. To actually insert the image, however, you need to use html, which you can read more about in the [Html Guide](https://github.com/CianStryker/Caspiana_Guide/blob/main/Omeka%20Website%20Guide/CSS%20and%20Html%20Guide/Html%20Code.docx)
