# Spreadsheet Guide for CASPIANA
Websites need to have a spreadsheet version in order to be migrated or uploaded quickly to platforms. I created a spreadsheet version (csv) of CASPIANA so that all information can be uploaded into the website's backend, which is what allows entries to be found through the search bar. In order to create this version I used R to organize the data, but now that it is in the correct format you shouldn't have to edit any further. If you do, however, I would recommend R for general data manipulation. I am not  including the actual csv file for CASPIANA in this repository. You can find that it the [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHbX0fnF3CA1h0DvPacjhI9kU9f8bhYX/edit#gid=1506660950) instead. 

The spreadsheet currently consists of 9 columns.
