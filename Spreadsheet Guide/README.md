# Spreadsheet Guide for CASPIANA
Websites need to have a spreadsheet version in order to be migrated or uploaded quickly to platforms. I created a spreadsheet version (csv) of CASPIANA so that all information can be uploaded into the website's backend, which is what allows entries to be found through the search bar. In order to create this version I used R to organize the data. I will include code written in R markdown documents with substantial comments, so that you can potentially recreate the data organization that I did. This code may also be useful if you decide to reorganize the csv into a new format if the Program on Central Asia decides to migrate CASPIANA to a new website in the future. 

# R Studio Guide
If you want to access my code in R Studio you can do so easily by starting a new project in R with Version Control. When you hit "Version Control" copy and past the code url from the overall Caspiana_Guide repository to create a version of this repo locally on your computer. Then just find this Spreadsheet Guide and you will be able open and edit my R markdown documents directly. In that R markdown file I write code comments for each line to explain what I do. I am not, however, including the actual csv file for CASPIANA here.  You can find that in the Google Drive [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHbX0fnF3CA1h0DvPacjhI9kU9f8bhYX/edit#gid=1506660950). In order for my code to work seamlessly, download a copy of the csv file from the Google Drive to your computer and then move in into the Spreadsheet Guide folder. Then you can simply run my code and it should work without any issues, assuming you have downloaded this entire repository.
